  <ul>

  <ol>
    <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, about 3 minutes. Drain.

    <li> Spread 1/2 of the pasta sauce on the bottom of a 5-inch round casserole dish. Layer with gnocchi and spread the remaining pasta sauce on top. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.
    <li> Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.
