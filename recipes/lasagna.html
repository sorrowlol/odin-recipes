    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil
      <li>1 medium onion, diced
      <li>1 pound hot Italian sausage
      <li> medium red bell pepper, diced
      <li>2 cups sliced mushrooms
      <li>1 (24 ounce) jar RAGÚ® Old World Style® Traditional Sauce
      <li>1 (9 ounce) package no-boil lasagna sheets, broken into large pieces
      <li>1 cup water
      <li>½ teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
      <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese
      <li>8 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided

    <h3> Directions </h3>

    <ol>
      <li> Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, red pepper, and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
      <li> Stir in the Ragu® Old World Style® Traditional sauce, broken lasagna noodles, water, and rosemary. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low.
      <li> Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente. Remove the lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese, and parsley; stir to combine. Top with remaining mozzarella and serve immediately.
